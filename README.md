# stereoscoper
Bulk process stereoscopic (3d) images

-----

Stereoscoper takes in one or more stereoscopic images and spits out a modified version.

It can split / merge / swap images, produce an animated gif, do alignment / depth adjustment, match colours between image pairs, and more.

For the interactive mode, here are the shortcuts:

	up / down (or j / k):    change vertical offset
	left / right (or h / l): change horizontal offset (depth)
	- / =:                   change brightness
	_ / +:                   change contrast
	0:                       reset brightness/contrast
	return:                  accept
	esc:                     cancel

Run --help to see all the batch options available.
